# Thanos remote read adapter

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
[![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/gresearchdev/thanos-remote-read)](https://hub.docker.com/r/gresearchdev/thanos-remote-read)

This allows querying a [Thanos](https://thanos.io) StoreAPI server (store,
query, etc.) from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

## Use cases

* [Long term storage](docs/longterm.md): Using Thanos as long term storage for a
  Prometheus instance, in a very transparent way (no need for users to even see
  thanos-query). This could be part of a migration strategy to fully use Thanos
  for example.
* ["ruler"](docs/ruler.md): Running rules outside of Thanos, to provide more
  predictable query reliability than thanos-ruler can offer.
* With [Geras](https://github.com/G-Research/geras): Use Geras to serve OpenTSDB
  data on Thanos StoreAPI, then make that data available to Prometheus.

## Building

Use the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gresearchdev/thanos-remote-read).

Or build latest master:

```
go get github.com/G-Research/thanos-remote-read
```

This will give you `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/thanos-remote-read`

## Running

This is a very simple proxy, so it accepts options of where to listen and where
to forward to:

```
Usage of ./thanos-remote-read:
  -listen string
        [ip]:port to serve HTTP on (default ":10080")
  -store string
        Thanos Store API gRPC endpoint (default "localhost:10901")
```

For example:
```
./thanos-remote-read -store localhost:10901
```

See the use cases for more background, `-store` can be pointed to anything
implementing Thanos StoreAPI, e.g. `thanos store`, `thanos query`, etc.

## Configuring Prometheus

```yaml
remote_read:
  - url: "http://localhost:10080/api/v1/read"
    # Potentially other options, see use cases docs and 
    # https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_read
```
